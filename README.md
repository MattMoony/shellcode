> **oh yeah, pls know that i'm not responsible for whatever you might decide to do with the code i host here; it's just some scripts i'm working on and that might be useful in ctfs or other occasions - oh, also, i'm not responsible for it being "good" shellcode or reliable shellcode, sadly i'm far from calling myself an expert**

> also know that for most occasions, something like [pwntools](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/shellcraft.html) especially with its pre-crafted payloads is probably a much better fit - still...
